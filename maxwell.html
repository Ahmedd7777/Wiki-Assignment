            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                “Maxwell was my first cat, and he was the runt of his litter. He also had some complications
                with a surgery, and that meant he had to wait to be adopted, so he was very lonely before I
                came to get him – his whole litter had gone! However, because of that, he was extremely
                affectionate and clingy. He was also a very large cat, so when he sat on my lap it didn’t
                take long for my legs to fall asleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                I adopted Mona when he was about a year and a half old, and they initially didn’t get along,
                but they did eventually grow to like each other. They would often lay together and he would
                groom Mona until she got cranky about it. Very funny to watch!
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I had to say goodbye to Maxwell way sooner than I would have liked – it
                turns out, he was born with only one kidney (among other issues, like the one mentioned
                when he was young), and he got a kidney infection. We were able to treat it, but it returned
                several months later, and the vet said there was no way he would make it. He was only 6
                years old. He is missed greatly, but he left a big impact on everyone’s lives, and lived his
                best and was well taken care of!”
            </p>
