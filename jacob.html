        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p1>
            Analogue sticks have been a ubiquitous part of video games for almost 30 years, but have you ever thought
            about the
            history of their conception? Starting in the 1970's several companies made use of rotating knob systems as a
            method for directional input in their games. While these controllers only worked in one dimension
            at a time- up or down, and left or right. Later, D-pads allowed for two dimensions of input, but with the
            advent of 3-D video games in
            the late 1980's, it became a necessity for players to be able to use a much larger range of directional
            inputs; Hence, the analogue stick!
        </p1>

        <p1>
            Precursors to analogue sticks arrived in the form of rotating knobs on "paddle" controllers. Prominent
            examples include Atari's 2600 and 5200,
            ColecoVision, Intellivision, and Magnavox Oddysey. These knobs made use of potentiometers, allowing for a
            range of input signals in one dimension.
            Up and down for games like "Pong", or left and right for titles such as "Breakout" and "Space Invaders".

        <h2 id="c2">Non-analogue Advancements</h2>
        <p1>
            By the 1980's games were quickly becoming more complex, and required more inputs to play. This meant
            additional buttons on the face of
            the controller, but more importantly, the D-pad. Allowing inputs for four cardinal directions <i>and
                diagonals</i>, the D-pad
            introduced a completely new form of video gaming. Since being brought into the spotlight by the Nintendo
            Entertainment System in 1983,
            all major video game controllers have featured a D-pad. Sony's playstation made use of a D-pad as it's only
            directional input, before
            upgrading to the Dualshock controller. The Nintendo 64, while being credited as the beginning of the
            analogue stick's prevelance,
            did not use potentiometers. Opting instead for a system of gears inside the stick's assembly, it operated
            much more like a trackball
            than any modern analogue stick we see today.

        <h2 id="c3">Current Age</h2>
        <p1>
            Although the technology has improved greatly, not much has changed in the world of analogue sticks for
            many
            years. In terms
            of design and innovation,
            things are largely the same as they were almost 30 years ago. Looking to the future, it's hard to say
            what
            could act as a replacement
            for such an integral part of gaming history.
